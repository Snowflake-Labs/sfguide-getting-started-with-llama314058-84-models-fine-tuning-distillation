## Overview

This guide provides the instructions for creating custom LLMs with synthetic data and distillation using Snowflake Cortex AI.

By the end of this quickstart guide, you will be able to use Snowflake Cortex AI to:
- **Generate Synthetic Data**: Prompt `llama3.1-405b` to generate synthetic customer support tickets.
- **Prepare**: Training dataset for distilling the knowledge from a foundation model into a small custom LLM.
- **Distill**: The knowledge from the large model to fine-tune model a smaller model and achieve high accuracy at fraction of cost.
- **Generate**: Custom email/text communications tailored to each support ticket
